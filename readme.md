# composer 

composer is a php dependency manager. All php packages can be found in https://packagist.org/ site. you may know    
* in frontend `npm`,`yarn`, `bower`     
* in ruby `gem`,`bundle`       
* in php `composer`,`pear`   
* in python `pip`    

is widely used dependency manager. In this tutorial I have shown how can we install composer and use composer to install php package from packagist    


## Installing composer in windows     
In order to download composer in windows os, just go to https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-windows page and download `Composer-Setup.exe` file. Once you download composer executable file just double click on it. On the way installing composer, it will ask for php.exe file path. In my case it automatically found php.exe file path. If its not your case, you should browse your php path. Once composer is installed, composer command will be available in your command line. By typing `composer` you will get all options and commands composer have. Mostly we use require package to install composer package.       

Other than installing package, using composer we can autoload our php file. Which actually help us to get rid of lot of laborious, complecated task.
